Fresh independent verifier verify_candidate_2: read source and try to refute the candidate. Source only; no writes/execution/network. Return actual JSON decision+record, not a summary.
# Architecture
Review the dirty worktree at commit1993506958b162b97d76bda16939b5c1079109f4, including uncommitted Gradio files. Public Gradio app.py downloads a fixed NVIDIA model revision, loads trusted remote model Python, uses server-side gr.State and UUID session/job directories, validates uploads in preflight/prepare before its 120s concurrency1 GPU handler, then emits previews and exports. Framework file routing/state/cache behavior remains a boundary to verify from locally available source. Input decoding occurs outside GPU reservation.
Local Windows launch.cmd binds Streamlit8472 to loopback and start-offline.ps1 publishes Docker worker8473 to loopback with read-only model mount. Existing container reuse does not re-establish its settings. Streamlit saved conversion_results is intentionally global for a single OS user. Worker serializes inference and reads at most100MiB. No product user accounts or tool-calling agent exist.
Shared PDFium/Pillow conversion renders and resizes documents, imports pinned NVIDIA postprocessing, writes fixed artifact names/numeric page indices and content-hash caches. Gradio injects per-job output directories. Model output is untrusted; HTML export uses bleach allowlists, Gradio Markdown sanitizes explicitly, Streamlit uses default Markdown controls. The NVIDIA HTTPS URL is constant and credentials are read server-side. Backend modes do not fall back automatically.
uv.lock describes Windows; requirements.txt describes Gradio; Docker resolves its own dependencies and copies server/probe only. Model provenance and dependency execution are trust boundaries. No CI/release workflow is in source. No independent comparable product baseline established beyond ordinary Gradio/Streamlit document workflows.
Scope is all first-party app/library/worker/launcher/tests/manifests/docs. Do not read user documents, credentials, models, caches or index content. Native library internals and hosted control planes are not audited as first-party source. No prior compatible ledger was found in workspace audit root. Graph lookup returned current selected CodeGraph source but empty code-review-graph communities; exact source remains decisive.
Four baseline reconnaissance assignments are complete. No required OS sandbox (network isolation, empty safe env, read-only tools/target, scratch-only writes, explicit CPU/memory/process/file/disk/time limits) or race-safe Windows artifact promotion is established. TARGET CODE EXECUTION IS FORBIDDEN. No network/live endpoints/provider control planes, installs, builds or tests. Prior functional live checks are not audit evidence. Source-only checks have artifact:null; runtime-dependent claims need_validation, never severity.

#### Candidate-verifier prompt

```text
You did not write this candidate. Try to refute it from repository source and bounded
local evidence. Do not contact deployed endpoints or external/shared services. Run
target-controlled code only inside the approved OS-enforced sandbox: no external
network, empty allowlisted environment, read-only target and tools, scratch-only
writes, and explicit low resource and wall-clock limits. If any control is unavailable,
do not execute; retain the exact missing capability as a needs_validation blocker.
Treat every scratch entry as target-controlled after execution. After the sandbox and
all its processes terminate, only trusted parent-side code may promote a predeclared
scratch-relative file, following the promotion procedure block included verbatim in
this prompt. You and target code never write retained artifacts. If promotion is
unavailable or fails, do not use that file as evidence.

1. Verify every trace and evidence file, positive line number, scope, and description.
   Confirm the first entry is a real lower-trust entrypoint and the last is the
   claimed sink or boundary effect.
2. Reconstruct the strongest source-visible validation, identity, authorization,
   normalization, lifecycle, framework, and containment controls on the path.
   Where the architecture summary names a comparable baseline, note whether it
   shares the pattern — as calibration, never as grounds to dismiss.
3. For a proposed confirmed candidate, independently reproduce the minimum observed
   result when possible. Verify inputs, interface shape, conditions, and affected
   dummy principal/resource. Do not infer a stronger result or continue after it.
4. Verify that likelihood, impact, confidence, and the proposed source fix match only
   what the evidence establishes.
5. For a proposed needs_validation candidate, decide whether the blocker is genuinely
   outside source/local observation. If source refutes the trace, reject it. If the
   missing fact remains decisive, keep needs_validation and make the local and
   owner-observed plans exact and non-destructive.
6. Preserve the fingerprint for the same source-derived root cause across every state.

Return exactly one JSON object and no surrounding prose:
{"decision": "confirmed|needs_validation|rejected", "record": { ... }}
where record exactly matches the decision's verdict branch of the schema included
in this prompt. A corrected record replaces the hunter's wording.
```

Copy this promotion procedure verbatim into every candidate-verifier prompt:

```text
Artifact promotion procedure (trusted parent-side code only):
Reference only for you: the parent performs these steps; you never perform them.

Before execution, the parent opens and retains trusted, non-inheritable directory
descriptors for the agent's scratch/ and artifacts/ roots, and records an allowlist
of expected scratch-relative artifact files plus explicit per-file and cumulative
byte limits. Never pass those descriptors to the agent or sandbox. After the sandbox
and all its processes terminate, trusted parent-side code promotes each allowlisted
file separately:

1. Validate the declared relative path: reject absolute, empty, `.`, `..`, or
   symlinked components.
2. Walk each parent component from the retained scratch-root descriptor with
   no-follow directory-relative operations; never reopen by path.
3. Open the leaf no-follow and nonblocking.
4. Verify with `fstat` that it is a regular file with link count exactly one and
   within the recorded per-file and cumulative byte limits.
5. Enforce those limits again while reading from that descriptor.
6. Copy exactly the verified size, repeat `fstat`, and reject a changed identity,
   type, link count, or size.
7. For the destination, walk every parent component from the retained
   artifacts-root descriptor with no-follow directory-relative operations; require
   each existing component to be a real directory, and create any missing directory
   exclusively before reopening and verifying it no-follow.
8. Create the leaf exclusively without following links, verify that the opened
   destination is a regular file with link count exactly one, and copy from the
   verified source descriptor without reopening either path.
9. Use equivalent race-safe APIs on non-POSIX systems.
10. Never recursively copy or glob scratch, extract an archive into artifacts, or
    open or promote a symlink, FIFO, socket, device, directory, hard-linked file,
    changing file, or file that exceeds its bound.
11. If any check is unavailable, cannot be enforced, or fails, discard the scratch
    entry; if it is decisive evidence, retain `needs_validation` with the exact
    promotion blocker.
```

A verifier can promote `needs_validation` to `confirmed` only after independently establishing the complete path and bounded observed result. Demote proposed confirmation to `needs_validation` when a specific deployment or runtime fact remains unknown. Use `rejected` when source, local behavior, a visible control, missing meaningful impact, or an impossible prerequisite refutes the claim. `needs_validation` is never a parking place for a speculative idea.

The parent checks that each verifier returned the same fingerprint unless it identified a genuinely different root cause. Merge corrections, record the decision in every linked coverage unit, and ensure there is one final record per fingerprint. Discard a malformed or prose-wrapped verifier result without repairing it; re-run that candidate with a fresh verifier when the budget permits, otherwise it remains an unvalidated ledger candidate under the incomplete-run rule.

When verifier evidence updates a ledger check, set that check's `agent_id` to the verifier's canonical ID and list its nonempty repository-relative `reviewed_paths`. Keep the unit-level `reviewed_paths` equal to the union across checks. Use `method: "source"` with `artifact: null` for source-only review. Use `method: "local"` only with a file successfully promoted by trusted parent-side code below `agents/<check.agent_id>/artifacts/`. The unit retains its original assignment owner, so independently owned hunter and verifier checks can coexist. For a carried prior record's seeded `planned` unit there is no prior owner: the verifier that re-checks it becomes the unit's assignment owner, and its re-check is the unit's first check, moving the unit to `candidate` with the carried fingerprint.

If a strict total-agent budget cannot cover every candidate, set the run status to incomplete and follow the deterministic budget rule in `SKILL.md`. An unvalidated candidate remains only in the ledger. It does not enter `findings.json` under any verdict.
